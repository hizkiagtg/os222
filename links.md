# Week 1

1. [Debian Command](https://wiki.debian.org/ShellCommands)<br>
This website provides all shell commands in debian. It's very helpful for someone like me

2. [OS 101](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/index.htm)<br>
Website that explains about all OS concept. This website provides all useful information.

3. [Regex 101](https://regex101.com/)<br>
Regex is quite difficult for me to understand. But, this website explains all the things that I need to know about rege>

# Week 2

1. [GnuPG 101](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html)<br>
GNU PG is an implementation symmetric-key cryptography. This website provides all useful information and docomentation about GnuPG. It will be very useful for beginner.

2. [Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/)<br>
Cryptography may be complicated for someone who are just learning it or just hear about it. But, this website provide full course and material (text book) for beginner who want to learn more about cryptography.

3. [C 101](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php)<br>
C is one of the most useful language if we want to understand about operating system. This website provides complete exercises and tutorials on the C language. 

# Week 3
1. [File System in Linux](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-file-system#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Linux%20File,more%20information%20about%20a%20file.)<br>

A Linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition. A partition is a segment of memory and contains some specific data. In our machine, there can be various partitions of the memory. It's quite difficult to learn this concept at first. But, this website explains file system in a good way.

2. [General overview of Linux File System and Partitioning](https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html)<br>

"On a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process". This website provides general overview of file system in UNIX system. This website also describe about partitioning in a good way, and with the easiest way to understand.
# Week 4

1. [Linux Memory Management](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-memory-management#:~:text=The%20subsystem%20of%20Linux%20memory,programs%20and%20kernel%20internal%20structures.)<br>

Linux memory management subsystem is a complicated system with several configurable settings. This website will be very usefull to learn that memory management in linux

2. [Paging in Memory Management Linux](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/Theory/linux-theory-1.html)<br>

Paging is a proccess that divide logical memory into blocks. This website will give provide a good explanation about paging and the process.

# Week 5

1. [High and Low Memory in Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4929/what-are-high-memory-and-low-memory-on-linux)<br>

Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first. This web explain the detail about this concept.

2. [Virtual Memory 101](https://tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/vm-intro.html#:~:text=Linux%20supports%20virtual%20memory%2C%20that,be%20used%20for%20another%20purpose.)<br>

Linux supports virtual memory, that is, using a disk as an extension of RAM so that the effective size of usable memory grows correspondingly. The kernel will write the contents of a currently unused block of memory to the hard disk so that the memory can be used for another purpose. This web explain the detail about this concept.

# Week 6

1. [Thread and Process in LINUX](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/process-vs-thread)<br>

This link explains the detail about thread and process, and also give the differencess between them. A process itself is a computer program under execution, and a thread is a 
lightweight process

2. [Thread and Concurrency](https://medium.com/@akhandmishra/operating-system-threads-and-concurrency-aec2036b90f8)<br>

This link describes the detail about thread and concurrency. A thread is an active entity which executes a part of a process, and each different thread has a different stack, stack pointer register, and other register. Because there exist a multicore, sometimes we need to run some threads simultaneously.
# Week 7

1. [Deadlock in OS](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html)<br>

This link provides helpful information about detail of deadlock concept.
Deadlock itself is a situation that occurs in OS when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demanded resource. 


2. [Synchronization in OS](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)<br>
Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources. This concept is realy important in OS, and this link provide the detail about that process.

# Week 8
1. [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/11.0/)<br>
This website provide all information about linux from scrath. It will help you to build your own linux system, step by step. All the information is given in this web, but sometimes you need to search from another source if an error occurs.

2. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
In this week, we learn about scheduling. Scheduling itself has several parts. In this web, we will learn about scheduling an its parts. It will give you the detail about scheduling, and can help your understanding.

# Week 9
1. [Mass-Storage Structure](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/10_MassStorage.html)<br>
This source is useful as a complementary material to the slides, as the contents are similar to the slides.
2. [Disk Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.101computing.net/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
The source provides thorough explanations on disk scheduling algorithms, providing examples to help learners better understand the concepts.
